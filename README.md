🛠️ Software Testing WebApps

Welcome to the Software Testing WebApp project repository! 🚀
This web application provides a comprehensive overview of the importance of testing in the software lifecycle, with particular emphasis on the different types of tests (manual and automated) and on Automation Testing techniques.
It also offers practical examples and resources for further study, thus improving users' knowledge of Quality Assurance (QA).

🌟 Project objective
The objective of this webapp is to inform and educate users on the fundamental role of testing in the software development cycle.

The webapp includes:
✅ An overview of the various types of testing, including Functional Testing, Automation Testing, Integration Testing, BDD, and TDD.
🧑‍💻 Real code examples for test automation using popular tools such as Selenium, Cypress, Jest, PyTest, Appium.
🔗 Links to external resources for further study.
📝 An interactive module explaining the different types of tests with applicable use cases.
🛠️ Technologies Used

The project is developed using the following technologies:
Frontend: React.js + Bootstrap
💻 React ensures a dynamic and interactive interface, while Bootstrap guarantees a modern and responsive design.

Backend: Node.js + Express
🛠️ Node.js provides the server-side basis for the app, and Express handles user authentication and interaction with the server.

Database: MongoDB
📦 A non-relational database to manage user data and track progress.

Authentication: Authentication via JWT to provide customised access to specific resources and track user progress.

✨ Functionality
Test overview: Detailed explanation of the main types of tests used in QA.
Code Examples: Includes real examples of test automation with tools such as Selenium, Cypress, Jest, Appium and PyTest.
External resources: Useful links for more in-depth information.

Interactive module: Users can discover and better understand how different tests work, including practical examples.
📖 Types of tests covered
Functional Testing
Tests that the software behaves according to the specified functional requirements.

Automation Testing
Using tools such as Selenium, Cypress, JUnit, Appium to automate repetitive testing, reducing human intervention and increasing accuracy.

Integration Testing
Ensures that the different software modules work together as intended, using tools such as Postman, JUnit, PyTest.

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
Focused on the behaviour of the application from the end user's point of view.

Test Driven Development (TDD)
Development approach in which tests are written before the code.

⚙️ Instructions for starting the project
1. Backend
Open the backend folder:

bash
cd backend
Change the version of Node.js to the latest available (in this case, the version you are using is 20.16.0). If you are using nvm (Node Version Manager), you can do this with the command 

bash
nvm install 20.16.0
nvm use 20.16.0

Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
npm install
Start the server with the command

bash
npm run dev

2. Frontend
Open the frontend folder:

bash
cd frontend
Install the dependencies:

bash
npm install
Start the React application with the command

bash
npm run start

Visit the app at http://localhost:8080
